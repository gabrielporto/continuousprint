# Scripting

**Control what happens in between queued prints by using Events to run Scripts**.

## Events

Events fire at certain points when the queue is being run - when a print completes, for instance. You can see the full list of events by going to `Settings > Continuous Print > Events` or [looking here in the source code](https://github.com/smartin015/continuousprint/blob/master/continuousprint/data/__init__.py).

When an event fires, you can run one or more configured scripts. These events are also visible to other OctoPrint plugins (e.g. [OctoPrint-IFTTT](https://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/IFTTT/)) and can be used to perform actions in them.

## Scripts

Event scripts, just like 3D print files, are in GCODE. Each script is a series of commands that are sent to the printer that tell it to move, heat up, cool down, etc.

GCODE scripts can be quite complex - it's recommended to load default scripts if you're just getting started, or as examples to modify. If you want to learn to make your own scripts, try reading through [this primer](https://www.simplify3d.com/support/articles/3d-printing-gcode-tutorial/).

### Load Defaults

If your 3D printer is common, you should first check the user-contributed default scripts for your printer.

To load default scripts:

1. Navigate to `Settings > Continuous Print > Profile` and ensure the make and model of your 3D printer is correct.
1. Click on the `Scripts` tab, then click `Load from Profile`. You should see two new scripts ("Bed Clearing" and "Finished") appear matching your printer make and model.
1. Click on the `Events` tab and scroll down to `Print Success`.
1. Replace the Bed Clearing script there with the new one.
1. Scroll down to `Queue Finished` and replace its script with the new script.
1. Click `Save`.

If you want to contribute a change or a new default script, read the [Contributing](#contributing) section below. You can browse through all the scripts [here](https://github.com/smartin015/continuousprint/blob/master/continuousprint/data/gcode_scripts.yaml).

### Custom Scripts

You can also set up your own custom scripts to run when events happen.

To add a new custom script:

1. Navigate to `Settings > Continuous Print > Scripts`, then click `New Script`. A new (unnamed) script will appear in the list.
1. Put your GCODE script in the large text box - as an example, try typing in `@pause` to pause the print and wait for you to resume it.
1. Give the script a name (e.g. "Example Script"), then click the Done button at the bottom of the edit area.

Your script is now created, but it will not run until we assign it to one or more events.

To register the script to an event:

1. Click the `Events` tab and scroll to the desired event. For example, `Queue Deactivated` which runs when you click the `Stop Managing` button.
1. Click the `Add Script` button, then the name of your script. You should now see it listed below the event name.
1. Click `Save` to save your settings.

Now try it out! Whenever your event fires, it should run this new script.

!!! Tip

    You can use the same script for multiple events, e.g. run bed clearing after each print *and* when the last print is finished.

    You can also run multiple scripts in the same event - they are executed from top to bottom, and you can drag to reorder them.

### Advanced: Skip certain commands in GCODE files

In `Settings > Continuous Print > Behaviors` there's an `Ignore GCODE lines while printing` text box where you can specify parts of `.gcode` files to ignore.

This is useful if your gcode slicer includes cleanup code to turn off hotends, heated beds, stepper motors etc. which may be important when printing without Continuous Print, but which aren't useful when printing multiple files in a row.

Here's an example of the end of a .gcode file sliced with Kiri:Moto:

```
; --- shutdown ---
G28 ;(Stick out the part)
M190 S0 ;(Turn off heat bed, don't wait.)
G92 E10 ;(Set extruder to 10)
G1 E7 F200 ;(retract 3mm)
M104 S0 ;(Turn off nozzle, don't wait)
M107 ;(Turn off part fan)
M84 ;(Turn off stepper motors.)
M82 ; absolute extrusion mode
M104 T0 S0
```

In this case, you may want to have the following configuration for `Ignore GCODE lines while printing`:

```
M190 S0
M104 S0
M104 T0 S0
M107 ; may also occur at the start, bed adhesion may be affected
M84
```

Be advised that:

* This setting does not apply to Continuous Print event scripts, only to `.gcode` files being printed.
* Comments are stripped away when comparing lines in the .gcode file to lines in the settings textbox
	(e.g. `M84 ; this is a comment` will match `M84 ; a different comment`)
* Commands are not case sensitive (e.g. `m84` will match `M84`)
* Apart from the above behaviors, the commands must match exactly (e.g. `M190` in gcode will not match `M190 S0`)
* Any removed cooling / stepper disabling commands should probably be added to a "Queue Finished" event script, so that the printer is put in a safe state
when all jobs are completed.
* Any changes to the list of ignored commands will take effect after a restart of OctoPrint.

### Optional: Use BedReady to check bed state

[OctoPrint-BedReady](https://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/bedready/) is a plugin that checks the webcam image of the bed against a refrence image where the bed is clear.

If you install BedReady, you can add an automated check that the bed is clear for the next print by adding `@BEDREADY` onto the end of your bed clearing script.

## Preprocessors

You may discover that you want more complex behavior than just running the same script every time an event happens - maybe you want to revert to manual part removal if the print is too small to remove automatically, or you want to sweep prints off in a different direction depending on their material or file name.

This can be done by adding a **Preprocessor**, which is a little bit of extra code that modifies how your GCODE script is executed.

### The Basics

Preprocessors are optionally added to assigned scripts in the `Events` settings tab. They evaluate based on instantaneous state details, print file metadata, and optional externally provided state.

* An Event can have multiple Scripts; each Script executes in-order when the Event fires.
* Each Script can have either zero or one Preprocessor assigned.
  * If it does not have a Preprocessor, it is run as-is.
  * If it does have a Preprocessor, the Preprocessor is run first and its output is applied to that Script before that script is executed.

### Language

Preprocessors are evaluated using [ASTEVAL](https://newville.github.io/asteval/) which is a [Python](https://www.python.org/)-like interpreter. Most simple Python scripts will run just fine.

If you're new to writing Python code and the examples in `Settings > Continuous Print > Scripts` don't have the answers you need, check out [here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide) for language resources, or open a new [discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/smartin015/continuousprint/discussions).

### Return Value

The final line of a preprocessor is used to modify the behavior of the GCODE script:

* **If the last line evaluates to `True` or `False`**, then it either runs or supresses the script, respectively.
* **If the last line evaluates to `None`**, then it suppresses the script.
* **If the last line evalutes to a `dict` object**, then the items are injected into the GCODE script (they're treated as keyword arguments in a call to [format()](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#the-string-format-method))

To clarify that last option, if you have a GCODE script that looks like:

```
G0 X{move_dist}
```

And you have a preprocessor that looks like:

```
dict(move_dist = 10 if current['path'].endswith("_right.gcode") else -10)
```

Then the printer will receive `G0 X10` for files named e.g. `file_right.gcode` and `G0 X-10` for all other files.

### Notifications

If you want to display any output from running your script, use the `print()` function like so:

```
print("Hello there!")
```

This will cause a status message to pop up with your printed message displayed. Multiple calls to `print` will be concatenated and shown in a single message.

### Examples

For more examples, see the default preprocessors and scripts in `Settings > Continuous Print > Scripts & Preprocessors` within OctoPrint. You can also browse [this YAML file](https://github.com/smartin015/continuousprint/blob/master/continuousprint/data/preprocessors.yaml) which is the source of those entries.

### Available State

When you write a Preprocessor, you will reference external information in your expression in order to return a boolean result. This is done by accessing `State` variables (referred to in [ASTEVAL docs](https://newville.github.io/asteval/) as the "symbol table").

Here's an example of what you can expect for state variables:

```
current: {
    'path': 'testprint.gcode',
    'materials': ['PLA_red_#ff0000'],
    'bed_temp': 23.59,
    'state': '_state_printing',
    'action': 'SUCCESS',
}
external: {<user provided>}
metadata: {
    'hash': '38eea2d4463053bd79af52c3fadc37deaa7bfff7',
    'analysis': {
        'printingArea': {'maxX': 5.3, 'maxY': 7.65, 'maxZ': 19.7, 'minX': -5.3, 'minY': -8.5608, 'minZ': 0.0},
        'dimensions': {'depth': 16.2108, 'height': 19.7, 'width': 10.6},
        'estimatedPrintTime': 713.6694555778557,
        'filament': {'tool0': {'length': 311.02239999999875, 'volume': 0.0}}
    },
    'continuousprint': {
        'profile': 'Monoprice Mini Delta V2'
    },
    'history': [
        {
          'timestamp': 1660053581.8503253,
          'printTime': 109.47731690102955,
          'success': True,
          'printerProfile': '_default'
        },
    ],
    'statistics': {
        'averagePrintTime': {'_default': 113.51082421375965},
        'lastPrintTime': {'_default': 306.7005050050211}
    }
}
```

Note that all variables in `current` (such as `path`, `materials`, and `bed_temp`) are all instantaneous variables about the current state, while `metadata` comes from file metadata analysis and is absent if `path` is None or empty.

See also `update_interpreter_symbols` in [driver.py](https://github.com/smartin015/continuousprint/blob/master/continuousprint/driver.py) for how state is constructed and sent to the interpreter.

### State Carryover

Any variable that you set when running a Preprocessor will also be made available to preprocessors that run after on the same event.

### External State

The `external` section of the state example above is where you'll find any custom data you inject via POST request to `/automation/external` - see the [API docs](/api/#inject-external-data-into-preprocessor-state) for details.

External data can come from anywhere that can reach your OctoPrint instance on the network - microservices, CRON jobs, IOT and other embedded systems, etc. However, ASTEVAL disables many of the more complex features of Python for security reasons. For this reason, you may want to do heavy processing (e.g. image or video segmentation, object detection, point cloud processing) elsewhere and then push only the information needed to format the event script.
